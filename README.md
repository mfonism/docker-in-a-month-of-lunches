# This is A Journey Book!

This repo is a mix of notes, lab walkthroughs, and little "aha!" moments, captured as I learn Docker by working my way through the book [_Learn Docker in a Month of Lunches_, by Elton Stoneman](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-docker-in-a-month-of-lunches)

## Why I'm Doing This

I didn't know intuitively how to use Docker. And I didn't want my only skill to be copy-pasting from the internet. Or using an LLM as my brain.
I prefer building a solid knowledge foundation for the things I do.

And because I love learning deliberately and in community, I reached out to my tech friends and invited them to learn Docker (and later Kubernetes) together over lunch breaks in October and November.

We formed a small group that checks in daily (Monday to Friday), working through the book at a slow, steady pace. This repo contains my full daily check-ins and lab solutions.

## Structure & Workflow

The book is designed to be tackled one lesson at lunchtime.

An ideal plan is stepping through the book on weekdays, a chapter a day, and then using weekends to rest or catch up.

## Disclaimer

This is a learning‚Äëin‚Äëpublic project.
Expect incomplete thoughts, occasional mistakes, and lots of experimentation.
Corrections, suggestions, or Docker tips are very welcome!
