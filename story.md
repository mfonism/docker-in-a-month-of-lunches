# ðŸ’¬ Why I'm Learning Docker This Way

So, I don't know how to use Docker. If I had to do something with it today, I'd probably use the internet and LLMs to hack something together. But I don't enjoy doing things that way. I like to have a foundational understanding &mdash; the kind that sticks.

And I love to learn things with friends. It gives me structure, makes it fun, and helps satisfy the part of me that wants to know that my friends are growing at least as much as I am.

So, I sent this message (on WhatsApp) to my friends in tech &mdash; folks who are at the point in their careers where it made sense to understand something like Docker:

> Hey hey,
>
> Are you (like me) a total novice when it comes to _Docker_ and _Kubernetes_? And would you be up for learning it in a group?
>
> I came across two books that look really beginner-friendly:
>
> \* _Learn Docker in a Month of Lunches_ https://www.manning.com/books/learn-docker-in-a-month-of-lunches
>
> \* _Learn Kubernetes in a Month of Lunches_ https://www.manning.com/books/learn-kubernetes-in-a-month-of-lunches
>
> The Kubernetes book assumes you already know some Docker, so we'll start with Docker. I'd really love to do this with community.
>
> If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, let me know and we can figure out how to make it work.

And o those who showed interest, I followed up with this:

> Hey hey,
>
> Good evening.
>
> I just made a WhatsApp group for the _Docker + Kubernetes_ lunchtime learning thing I told you about.
>
> It's a small, single-purpose group in a larger community, and I'd love for you to join. There are no expectations for the group beyond learning Docker and Kubernetes, so you can leave the moment you feel done, or if it stops being useful for you.
>
> A few other queer tech friends will be there too, so it should be a cozy, encouraging space.
>
> Please join us: <WhatsApp link removed to preserve privacy, ha ha>

In our plans, we learn Docker in October, and then Kubernetes in November &mdash; both books by the same author. We work through the book independently Monday to Friday, checking in whenever we can, and on weekends we catch up on readings we missed. Or rest.

My check-ins were getting pretty long, so I decided to start putting the full versions here, and just share the short summaries in the WhatsApp group.

Yep! That's the story!!
